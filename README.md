## Description

A simple, but effective homemade API that handles information pertaining to a social network, storing users, friend lists, and posts.

## Installation

To install the app locally:

- Ensure that Node.js is installed on your local machine
- Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your local machine
- Ensure that Insomnia is installed on your local machine
- Clone the GitHub repo to your local machine
- Use your local machine's command-line to navigate to the cloned repo's directory
- Run "npm install"
- Run "npm start"
- Enter http://localhost:3001/ in Insomnia, and use the RESTful API routes demonstrated in the [sample video below](#preview) to test out how you can modify the data

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- jQuery
- Node
- NPM
- Express
- NoSQL
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Usage

After installing this entirely back-end application, users interested in theoretical structure for a social media site or application may experiment with a number of RESTful API routes. The developer may create as many user accounts as they desire, as long as they have unique usernames and email addresses. A developer may also view a particular account using its uniquely assigned ID. The user may then choose to modify, or even delete specific user data as they desire. Additionally, the API contains basic functionality for allowing accounts to register other accounts as friends, and later delete said friends whenever needed. To further simulate social media interaction, valid accounts may post messages named "thoughts," which are then associated with the user who posted said thoughts. Similarly to the API routes regarding users, a developer may modify and delete previously posted thoughts as they wish. Lastly, a developer may allow user accounts to post "reactions" to specific thoughts. As expected based on the other shared features, the owner of a reaction may delete said reaction whenever they choose.
